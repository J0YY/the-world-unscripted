# Cinematic Video Files

Place these 4 short video clips here (MP4, 2-3 seconds each, ideally 480p or lower for a grainy feel):

1. **globe.mp4** — Low-orbit footage of the Earth spinning in fast motion
2. **diplomats.mp4** — Diplomats / politicians talking in front of media
3. **stocks.mp4** — Wall Street style stock trading floor / tickers
4. **military.mp4** — Military showcase (jets, tanks, soldiers marching, etc.)

Tips:
- Black-and-white filter is applied via CSS, so color videos work fine.
- Keep them short: 2-3 seconds max.
- Lower resolution = grittier look (the component pixelates them further).
